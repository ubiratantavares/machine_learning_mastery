Beginner Computer Vision Projects
 

Beginner projects are ideal for newcomers to computer vision, focusing on fundamental tasks like image classification and face detection to build foundational skills.

 


1. Plant Disease Detection
 
Plant disease detection is an important application of computer vision in agriculture. You will learn to load, process, and augment the dataset, build your deep neural network model, and train the model on the dataset. This project helps in understanding image classification and contributes to sustainable agriculture by enabling early disease detection.

2. Optical Character Recognition (English)
 
Optical character recognition technology allows computers to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. 

In this project, you will use the English Handwritten Characters dataset to fine-tune a pre-trained model, enhancing its ability to recognize and digitize handwritten text. The goal is to improve the accuracy of recognition, which is a crucial skill for automating data entry processes.

3. American Sign Language Image Classification
 
This project involves building a model to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. By using the American Sign Language Dataset, you can create a system that translates ASL into text, thereby aiding communication for the hearing impaired. This project is an excellent way to learn about multi-class classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). You will learn about image data analysis, model evaluation, and ways to improve your model.

Intermediate Computer Vision Projects
 
Intermediate projects challenge learners with real-time processing and more sophisticated algorithms. Examples include object tracking and image captioning, which is a multimodal problem that requires knowledge of both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision.

 


4. Car Number Plate Recognition
 
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems are widely used in traffic monitoring, parking management, and toll collection. The process involves collecting and labeling images for license plate detection, preprocessing the data, building and training a deep learning model for object detection, using the trained model to extract license plate regions for text recognition with an OCR model, and finally, creating an app that will extract the car number plate from the video in real-time.

5. Flickr Image Captioning
 
Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions for images. Using the Flickr Image dataset, you can build and train a Transformer model that describes the content of an image in natural language. This project combines computer vision and natural language processing, making it an exciting challenge for those looking to explore the intersection of these fields.

Advanced Computer Vision Projects
 

Advanced projects require a comprehensive grasp of computer vision concepts and programming skills, tackling complex tasks like autonomous vehicle navigation and medical image analysis.

 


6. Multi-person Pose Estimation and Tracking in Videos
 
Multi-frame human pose estimation in videos is difficult because of challenges such as motion blur and pose occlusions. These issues are difficult for static image models and traditional recurrent neural networks to handle. In this project, you will work with datasets like PoseTrack to track multiple people in videos. You will predict the location of key points such as hands and elbows, and also address the challenges of processing and understanding video data.
