The extensive development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) forced the job market to adapt. The era of AI and ML generalists has ended, and we entered the era of specialists.

It can be difficult even for more experienced to find their way around it, let alone beginners.

That’s why I created this little guide to understanding different AI and ML jobs.

## **What Are AI & ML?**

AI is a field of computer science that aims to create computer systems that show human-like intelligence.

![AI vs ML](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%205818%203153'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

ML is a subfield of AI that employs algorithms to build and deploy models that can learn from data and make decisions without explicit instructions being programmed.

## **Jobs in AI & ML**

The complexity of AI & ML and their various purposes results in various jobs applying them differently.

Here are the ten jobs I’ll talk about.

![Jobs in AI and ML](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%209043%202028'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Though they all require AI & ML, with skills and tools sometimes overlapping, each job requires some distinct aspect of AI & ML expertise.

Here’s an overview of these differences.

The extensive development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) forced the job market to adapt. The era of AI and ML generalists has ended, and we entered the era of specialists.

It can be difficult even for more experienced to find their way around it, let alone beginners.

That’s why I created this little guide to understanding different AI and ML jobs.

## **What Are AI & ML?**

AI is a field of computer science that aims to create computer systems that show human-like intelligence.

![AI vs ML](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%205818%203153'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

ML is a subfield of AI that employs algorithms to build and deploy models that can learn from data and make decisions without explicit instructions being programmed.

## **Jobs in AI & ML**

The complexity of AI & ML and their various purposes results in various jobs applying them differently.

Here are the ten jobs I’ll talk about.

![Jobs in AI and ML](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%209043%202028'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Though they all require AI & ML, with skills and tools sometimes overlapping, each job requires some distinct aspect of AI & ML expertise.

Here’s an overview of these differences.
