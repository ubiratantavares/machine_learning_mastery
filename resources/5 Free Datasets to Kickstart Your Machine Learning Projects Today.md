There are many free datasets online that help you practice and learn. These datasets allow you to try different machine learning techniques and improve your skills. You can find these datasets on platforms like Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository. Here are five free datasets that can help you start your machine learning projects.

## 1. Iris Dataset

**Description**: The Iris Dataset features information about three types of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset consists of four attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**Use Cases**:

- Training supervised learning algorithms like decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations like scatter plots and pair plots.
- Practicing feature scaling and selection techniques.

## 2. MNIST Handwritten Digits

**Description**: The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 pictures of handwritten numbers ranging from 0 to 9. Each picture is a grayscale image with a size of 28 by 28 pixels.

**Use Cases**:

- Training deep learning models for handwritten digit classification.
- Learning about image processing techniques like image normalization and augmentation.
- Understanding how to build models that can classify images into different categories.
